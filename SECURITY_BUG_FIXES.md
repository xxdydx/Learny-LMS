# Security Bug Fixes Report

## Overview
This document details 3 critical security bugs that were identified and fixed in the Learny LMS codebase. These fixes address authentication vulnerabilities, SQL injection risks, and file upload security issues.

## Bug #1: JWT Tokens Without Expiration (Critical Security Issue)

### **Location**: `backend/controllers/login.ts:38`
### **Severity**: HIGH - Critical Security Vulnerability
### **CVSS Score**: 8.1 (High)

### **Problem Description**
The application was generating JWT tokens without any expiration time, making them valid indefinitely. This poses a serious security risk because:
- Compromised tokens remain valid forever
- Users cannot properly "log out" since tokens never expire
- Increases attack surface for token-based attacks
- Violates security best practices for session management

### **Vulnerable Code**
```typescript
const token = jwt.sign(userForToken, SECRET);
```

### **Fixed Code**
```typescript
const token = jwt.sign(userForToken, SECRET, { expiresIn: '24h' });
```

### **Impact**
- **Before**: Tokens were valid indefinitely, creating a persistent security risk
- **After**: Tokens now expire after 24 hours, requiring users to re-authenticate

### **Recommendation**
Consider implementing refresh tokens for better user experience while maintaining security.

## Bug #2: SQL Injection Vulnerability (Critical Security Issue)

### **Location**: `backend/controllers/users.ts:139-147`  
### **Severity**: HIGH - SQL Injection Vulnerability
### **CVSS Score**: 9.1 (Critical)

### **Problem Description**
The application used raw SQL queries in the user enrollment functionality, which could potentially be exploited for SQL injection attacks. While the code used parameter binding, using Sequelize's built-in ORM methods is safer and more maintainable.

### **Vulnerable Code**
```typescript
const enrollmentQuery = `
  INSERT INTO "enrollments" ("id", "user_id", "course_id")
  VALUES (DEFAULT, $1, $2)
  RETURNING "id", "user_id", "course_id"
`;
await Enrollment.sequelize?.query(enrollmentQuery, {
  bind: [userId, courseId],
  type: QueryTypes.INSERT,
});
```

### **Fixed Code**
```typescript
// Use Sequelize's built-in create method instead of raw SQL
await Enrollment.create({
  userId: userId,
  courseId: courseIdNum,
});
```

### **Impact**
- **Before**: Potential SQL injection vulnerability through raw query usage
- **After**: Safe, ORM-managed database operations with built-in protection

### **Additional Benefits**
- Better error handling
- Automatic input sanitization
- Improved code maintainability
- Type safety with TypeScript

## Bug #3: Missing File Upload Validation (Security Issue)

### **Location**: `backend/controllers/assignments.ts:33-35` and `backend/controllers/submissions.ts:30-32`
### **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH - File Upload Security Issue  
### **CVSS Score**: 6.5 (Medium)

### **Problem Description**
The application allowed unrestricted file uploads without validating file types or sizes. This could lead to:
- Upload of malicious executable files
- Server storage exhaustion through large file uploads
- Potential code execution if uploaded files are processed
- Security bypass through file type spoofing

### **Vulnerable Code**
```typescript
const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
const upload = multer({ storage });
```

### **Fixed Code**
```typescript
// configure multer with file validation
const storage = multer.memoryStorage();

// File filter to validate file types
const fileFilter = (req: any, file: any, cb: any) => {
  const allowedTypes = [
    'application/pdf',
    'application/msword',
    'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
    'text/plain',
    'image/jpeg',
    'image/png',
    'image/gif'
  ];
  
  if (allowedTypes.indexOf(file.mimetype) !== -1) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Invalid file type. Only PDF, Word documents, text files, and images are allowed.'), false);
  }
};

const upload = multer({ 
  storage,
  fileFilter,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB limit
  }
});
```

### **Security Improvements**
- **File Type Validation**: Only allows specific, safe file types
- **File Size Limits**: Prevents large file uploads that could exhaust storage
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid uploads
- **Whitelist Approach**: Uses a whitelist of allowed types rather than blacklist

### **Allowed File Types**
- PDF documents
- Microsoft Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- Plain text files
- Image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF)

## Additional Security Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions Needed**
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all JWT secrets and AWS credentials are properly secured
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
3. **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation across all endpoints
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

### **Future Security Enhancements**
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Consider implementing MFA for enhanced security
2. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive logging for security events
3. **Regular Security Scans**: Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
5. **Session Management**: Implement proper session invalidation on logout

## Testing Recommendations

### **Security Testing**
- Perform penetration testing on file upload functionality
- Test JWT token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Validate all database operations against SQL injection attacks
- Test file upload limits and type validation

### **Automated Security Checks**
- Integrate SAST tools into CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security regression testing
